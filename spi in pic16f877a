# spi
In the context of PIC (Peripheral Interface Controller) microcontrollers, SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a synchronous serial communication protocol used for high-speed data transfer between the microcontroller and external devices like sensors, displays, or memory chips. The SPI protocol operates using a master-slave configuration, where the master controls the clock signal (SCK) and initiates communication. It typically uses four signals: MISO (Master In Slave Out), MOSI (Master Out Slave In), SCK (Serial Clock), and SS (Slave Select). SPI is widely used due to its simplicity, high data transfer rate, and full-duplex nature, allowing simultaneous sending and receiving of data.
